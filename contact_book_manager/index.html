      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate and dedicated final-year B.Tech student majoring in
        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at R.D. Engineering
        College. Over the years of my academic journey, I have developed a
        strong interest in solving real-world problems using technology,
        especially through programming. My preferred languages are Python and
        Java, and I have spent significant time building practical, hands-on
        projects that reflect both my creativity and technical understanding.
        One of the projects I’m proud of is the Bank ATM Simulator, a
        console-based Python program that allows users to perform basic banking
        operations like deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and secure
        login through a PIN. This project helped me understand core concepts
        such as input validation, user authentication, and exception handling.
        It was an excellent way to explore real-life banking functionalities in
        a simplified digital format. Another project that highlights my
        problem-solving mindset is the Password Strength Validator. This tool
        evaluates whether a user-created password is weak, moderate, or strong
        based on predefined rules like length, use of uppercase letters, digits,
        and special characters. Creating this project allowed me to improve my
        logic-building skills and understand the importance of security in
        software applications. Apart from programming, I am very enthusiastic
        about continuously improving myself through learning and
        experimentation. I enjoy reading about new technologies and applying
        them in small projects or challenges. My love for problem-solving
        doesn’t stop at code; I also participate in coding contests and practice
        regularly on competitive coding platforms. Outside of academics and
        coding, I have a strong personal interest in playing badminton. It not
        only keeps me active but also teaches me discipline, focus, and the
        importance of consistent effort—qualities that I carry into my technical
        work as well. As I approach the end of my undergraduate studies, I’m
        actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my technical skills in
        real-world projects and learn from industry professionals. I aim to be
        part of meaningful work that combines innovation, technology, and social
        impact. My goal is to contribute to AI/ML-based solutions that improve
        everyday life and make technology more accessible and efficient for all.
        In everything I do, I strive to be curious, creative, and
        consistent—whether I’m debugging a tricky piece of code, building
        something from scratch, or simply learning something new.

      <h3>Project 1:( Bank ATM Simulator )</h3>
      <p>
        The **Bank ATM Simulator** is a simple Python-based console application
        that simulates basic ATM functionalities. It allows a user to log in
        using a predefined 4-digit PIN and perform essential banking operations
        such as checking their balance, depositing money, withdrawing funds, and
        exiting the session. The program uses basic control structures, input
        validation, and error handling to ensure smooth user interaction.
        Designed for beginners, this project helps reinforce core Python
        concepts like loops, conditionals, user input, and exception handling,
        making it a practical exercise for learning fundamental programming
        skills.

      <h3>Project 2 (Password Strength Validator):</h3>
      <p>
        The **Password Strength Validator** is a Python-based utility designed
        to assess the robustness of user passwords based on a set of predefined
        security rules. It checks whether a password meets key criteria such as
        a minimum length of 8 characters, the inclusion of at least one
        uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special
        character (like `!@#$%^&*()-_+=`). Based on how many of these conditions
        are satisfied, the validator classifies the password as **Strong**,
        **Moderate**, or **Weak**, thereby encouraging users to create more
        secure credentials. This tool is especially useful for applications that
        require basic client-side validation before password storage or
        submission, helping reduce vulnerability to attacks like brute force or
        credential stuffing.
